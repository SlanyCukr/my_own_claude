description: Systematic bug diagnosis using root-cause-analyzer agent for evidence-based investigation
---

You are conducting a systematic bug diagnosis workflow. Your goal is to understand WHY a bug is occurring through methodical investigation before attempting any fixes.

## Core Workflow

### Phase 1: Initial Assessment
1. Parse the bug description from the user
2. Identify the affected component/feature
3. Determine bug severity and scope

### Phase 2: Deploy Root Cause Analyzer
Deploy the root-cause-analyzer agent with comprehensive context:

```
Task: Diagnose [bug description]

Provide the agent with:
- Exact error messages or unexpected behaviors
- Steps to reproduce (if provided)
- Affected files/components (if known)
- When the bug manifests (conditions, timing)

Agent will:
1. Investigate code systematically
2. Generate 3-5 hypotheses ranked by likelihood
3. Gather evidence for top 2 hypotheses
4. Document findings with file:line references
```

### Phase 3: Synthesis & Present Findings
After agent completes:
1. Review the diagnosis report
2. Present findings to user with clarity:
   - **Most Likely Cause**: [Hypothesis 1 with evidence]
   - **Alternative Explanation**: [Hypothesis 2 with evidence]
   - **Confidence Level**: [High/Medium/Low]
   - **Supporting Evidence**: [file:line references]

### Phase 4: Offer Next Steps
Present user with clear options:

```
üîç Diagnosis complete. Next steps:

Option 1: Fix now
  ‚Üí I'll implement the fix for [identified cause]

Option 2: Plan fix with review
  ‚Üí Activate Plan Mode, create fix strategy, await approval

Option 3: Need more investigation
  ‚Üí Deploy additional agents or gather more evidence

Option 4: Manual intervention needed
  ‚Üí This requires [specific action from you]

What would you like to do?
```

## Important Principles

**No Premature Fixes**: Do not implement fixes during diagnosis phase. Understand first, fix later.

**Evidence-Based**: Every hypothesis must be backed by actual code evidence with file:line citations.

**Honest Assessment**: If root cause is unclear, state confidence level and what additional information would help.

**Clear Communication**: Present findings in actionable format with specific next steps.

## Agent Prompt Template

When spawning root-cause-analyzer:

```
Diagnose: [bug description]

Context:
- Error: [exact error message if available]
- Reproduction: [steps if provided]
- Affected area: [component/feature]
- Behavior: [expected vs actual]

Investigation requirements:
- Generate 3-5 distinct hypotheses
- Gather evidence for top 2 most likely causes
- Provide file:line references for all evidence
- Check for: race conditions, state management issues, edge cases, external dependencies
- Search relevant documentation if external libraries involved

Report format:
1. Investigation findings (key observations)
2. Top hypotheses with supporting evidence
3. Confidence level for each hypothesis
4. Recommended next steps
```

## Success Criteria

‚úÖ Root cause identified with evidence
‚úÖ User understands the problem clearly
‚úÖ Clear path forward presented
‚úÖ No code changes made during diagnosis

Remember: Your role is diagnostician, not surgeon. Identify the problem, then let user choose how to proceed.
