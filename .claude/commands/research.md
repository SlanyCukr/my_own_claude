description: Deploy parallel research agents for comprehensive codebase understanding with evidence-based findings
---

You are conducting a deep research investigation into a codebase topic. Your goal is to provide comprehensive, evidence-based understanding through systematic parallel research.

## Core Workflow

### Phase 1: Scope Definition
1. Parse the research topic from user input
2. Identify research scope:
   - **Focused**: Single feature/component (1-2 agents)
   - **Moderate**: System/subsystem (2-3 agents)
   - **Comprehensive**: Architecture/cross-cutting (3-4 agents)
3. Automatically switch to deep-research output style

### Phase 2: Parallel Research Deployment

Deploy specialized agents based on research type:

#### For Feature/Component Understanding:
```
Agent 1: code-finder-advanced
Task: Trace [feature] implementation
- Find all files involved
- Map data flow
- Identify entry points and boundaries
- Document patterns used

Agent 2: code-finder-advanced
Task: Analyze [feature] dependencies
- Map all imports and exports
- Identify external library usage
- Find related components
- Check for circular dependencies
```

#### For Architectural Understanding:
```
Agent 1: code-finder-advanced
Task: Map [system] architecture
- Identify major components
- Trace communication patterns
- Document design patterns

Agent 2: codebase-research-analyst
Task: Analyze [system] structure
- Dependency relationships
- Layer separation
- Module boundaries

Agent 3: code-finder-advanced (if needed)
Task: Security/performance analysis
- Identify potential issues
- Check best practices adherence
```

#### For "How Does X Work?" Questions:
```
Agent 1: code-finder-advanced
Task: Trace execution flow for [X]
- Follow code path from trigger to completion
- Document state changes
- Identify side effects

Agent 2: code-finder-advanced
Task: Analyze [X] integration points
- How it connects to other systems
- External API calls
- Database interactions
```

### Phase 3: Evidence Synthesis
After all agents complete:
1. Cross-reference findings from all agents
2. Identify patterns and commonalities
3. Note any contradictions or gaps
4. Build comprehensive understanding with confidence ratings

### Phase 4: Structured Report

Present findings in this format:

```markdown
# Research Report: [Topic]
**Confidence**: [High/Medium/Low]
**Agents Deployed**: [count] parallel streams

## Executive Summary
[2-3 sentences capturing key findings]

## Key Findings
1. **[Finding]** [Confidence: High/Medium/Low]
   - Evidence: [file:line references from agents]
   - Implication: [what this means]

2. **[Finding]** [Confidence: High/Medium/Low]
   - Evidence: [file:line references]
   - Cross-reference: [related findings]

## Architecture/Structure
[Visual or textual map of components]
- Component A: [purpose] (file:line)
- Component B: [purpose] (file:line)
- Relationships: [how they connect]

## Dependencies
- Internal: [list with purposes]
- External: [libraries/services with versions]

## Patterns Identified
- **Pattern Name**: [description] (seen in: files)

## Knowledge Gaps
[What couldn't be determined]
[What would increase confidence]

## Recommended Actions
1. [Next steps based on findings]
2. [Areas needing attention]
```

### Phase 5: Offer Next Steps

```
ðŸ“Š Research complete. Options:

Option 1: Save report
  â†’ /save-to-md .docs/research/[topic]-analysis.md

Option 2: Proceed to planning
  â†’ Use findings to plan implementation
  â†’ Switch to planning mode

Option 3: Deeper investigation
  â†’ Deploy additional agents for specific areas
  â†’ Focus on [identified gap]

Option 4: Start implementation
  â†’ Proceed with changes based on understanding

What would you like to do?

## Research Agent Prompt Template

For code-finder-advanced:
```
Research: [specific aspect of topic]

Focus areas:
- [List 3-5 specific questions to answer]

Requirements:
- Map complete execution paths
- Document with file:line references
- Identify non-obvious patterns
- Note library/framework usage
- Cross-reference related code

Output:
- Structured findings with evidence
- Confidence rating per finding
- Gaps identified
```

For codebase-research-analyst:
```
Analyze: [system/architecture aspect]

Investigation targets:
- Overall structure and organization
- Dependency relationships
- Design pattern usage
- Architectural decisions

Requirements:
- Comprehensive component mapping
- Evidence-based analysis
- Document rationale where visible

Output:
- Architectural overview
- Component interaction map
- Pattern catalog
```

## Quality Standards

**Evidence-Based**: Every claim backed by file:line references
**Confidence-Rated**: Mark findings as High/Medium/Low confidence
**Gap-Honest**: Explicitly state what couldn't be determined
**Cross-Referenced**: Synthesize findings from multiple agents
**Actionable**: Provide clear next steps based on research

## Success Criteria

âœ… Comprehensive understanding of research topic
âœ… Multiple agents provided consistent findings
âœ… Evidence trail for all major claims
âœ… Knowledge gaps explicitly identified
âœ… User knows what to do next

Remember: Research provides understanding, not solutions. Build complete context before suggesting actions.
